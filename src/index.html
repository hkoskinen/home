      <p>These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>

      <p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</p>

      <p>A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.</p>

      <p>Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. In your world you have total and absolute power. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>
